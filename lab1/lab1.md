# Linear Regression and Stochastic Gradient Descent

## Abstract
In this report, we will solve linear regression using both the closed-form solution and gradient descent method based on a small dataset.
After that, we will further learn to tune some parameters such as the learing rate to optimizate our gradient descent model.  

## I.Introduction
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression.\[[1](linear_regression Wikipidea)\]

Motivations of the report are listed below:
* Further understand of linear regression ，closed-form solution and Stochastic gradient descent.
* Conduct some experiments under small scale dataset.
* Realize the process of optimization and adjusting parameters.
